description: |
  The Anbox Cloud NFS operator provides additional NFS storage to Anbox containers.

  In various uses cases it is required to provide additional data to Anbox containers,
  for example for game streaming where game assets need to be provision ahead of time
  so the games do not have to download it on first start.

  This charmed operator implements this by adding an NFS mount to the machine which
  will provide access to remote storage. To avoid multiple network transfer of the
  same data, the operator will install a cache, powered by cachefilesd.
